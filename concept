Monsters and Traps:
  Fire geysers: Spring up randomly to keep the hero on his toes. The more damage
    the crystal has taken, the more geysers pop up
  Minions: Twins that are immune to blades, and will take one piece of the
    hero's armor instead of his life, if he's got it.
  Spiders: Walk along the ceiling until right above the hero, then drop and
    spin him up.
  Gelatinous Blob: splits in to two minions when hit
  Snake Boss: Can be slowed, take double head shot damage, and turn to stone
    and crumble away on death, leaving behind a treasure.
  Rock Golems: Throw rocks, and drop loot.

- boss animation is flickery :(
